            You have indicated in your NOI that there are waters of the U.S. that exist within or immediately adjacent
            to your site.  Because of the proximity of these waters to your construction activities, be advised that you
            are required to comply with the buffer requirements in Part 2.2.1.  This provision requires that you comply
            with one of the following three compliance alternatives:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Provide and maintain a 50-foot undisturbed natural buffer; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide and maintain an undisturbed natural buffer that is less than 50 feet and is supplemented by
                    erosion and sediment controls that achieve, in combination, the sediment load reduction equivalent
                    to a 50-foot undisturbed natural buffer; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    If infeasible to provide and maintain an undisturbed natural buffer of any size, implement erosion
                    and sediment controls to achieve the sediment load reduction equivalent to a 50-foot undisturbed
                    natural buffer.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            You must document the compliance alternative you have selected in your SWPPP, and comply with the applicable
            additional requirements described in CGP Appendix G.
