           You have indicated in your NOI that you discharge to at least one water of the U.S. that is listed as impaired by
           the state or tribe in which your project is located.  If your site discharges to one or more waters of the
           U.S. that are impaired for sediment or a sediment-related parameter (e.g., total suspended solids or turbidity)
           or nutrients (e.g., nitrogen or phosphorus), you are required to comply with additional stormwater control
           requirements pertaining to the deadline to complete site stabilization in Part 2.2.14(a)(iii)(c) and site
           inspections in Part 4.3. If your site discharges to waters of the U.S. that are impaired for pollutants other
           than a sediment or nutrients, or related pollutants, you are only subject to additional measures or controls
           if EPA informs you separately of such.
