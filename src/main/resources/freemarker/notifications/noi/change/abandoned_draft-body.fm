           Dear ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.firstName} ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.lastName},
        </p>
        <p>
            Our records indicate that you last modified a draft Change Notice of Intent (NOI) for coverage under the EPA
            Construction General Permit (CGP) 30 or more days ago. In order for these changes to become active, your
            Change NOI must be completed, signed by the Certifier (i.e., the entity at your organization authorized to
            sign/certify the NOI for your site), and submitted to the EPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please log in to the NPDES Electronic Reporting Tool (NeT) to review and take action on this form.  NeT can
            be accessed from: <a href="${applicationLink}">${applicationLink}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, you can use the filtering capability to find the applicable NOI. Complete the sections of
            the NOI, and then choose the Route to Certifier option at the end of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not wish to complete this CGP NOI, you may delete the NOI through the table of forms located on
            your home page.  Please note that once you delete an NOI, you will not be able to complete it in the future.
            You will have to create a brand new NOI.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this email or about NeT CGP, please refer to the NeT Help Center
            at <a href="${netHelpCenter}">${netHelpCenter}</a> or e-mail ${npdesEmail} for assistance.
