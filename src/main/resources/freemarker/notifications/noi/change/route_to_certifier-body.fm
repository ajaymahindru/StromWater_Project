            Changes to an existing Notice of Intent (NOI) requesting coverage under EPA's Construction General Permit (CGP)
            for stormwater discharges from ${form.formData.projectSiteInformation.siteName}, ${form.formData.projectSiteInformation.siteAddress},
            has been prepared by ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.firstName} ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.lastName}
            (${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.email}) with you listed as the Certifier. This NOI will not
            be submitted to the EPA until it is certified by you. Please log in to the NPDES Electronic Reporting Tool
            (NeT) to review and take action on this form.  NeT can be accessed from: <a href="${applicationLink}">${applicationLink}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, use the filtering options on the landing page to find the applicable NOI. After you review
            the form, navigate to the Certification Information section, read the Certification Statement, and
            Certify or Reject the submission.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose not to certify the NOI, select “Reject”, enter a Reason for Rejection, and submit.  This action
            will route the rejected form back to the Preparer in NeT, and generate an email notifying the Preparer that
            the form has been rejected, your reason for rejection, and instructions to resubmit as needed.
        </p>
