            As you know, the CGP requires you to have developed a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prior to
            submitting your NOI.  The CGP also includes specific requirements for erosion and sediment controls,
            pollution prevention controls, conducting self-inspections, taking corrective actions, and conducting staff
            training.  You must comply with any state, tribal, or territory-specific requirements in Part 9
            (see <a href="${stormwaterCgp}">${stormwaterCgp}</a>).

            Please note that this email does not represent a determination by EPA regarding the validity of the
            information you provided in your NOI. Your eligibility for coverage under this permit is based on the
            validity of the certification you provided. Your electronic signature on the NOI form certifies that you have
            read, understood, and are implementing all of the applicable requirements. An important aspect of this
            certification requires that you have correctly determined whether you are eligible for coverage under this permit.
