           Dear ${ownerFirstName} ${ownerLastName},
        </p>
        <p>
            Our records indicate that you created a draft Notice of Intent (NOI) for coverage under the EPA Construction
            General Permit (CGP) 30 or more days ago. To become authorized under the EPA CGP, your NOI must be completed,
            signed by the Certifier (i.e., the entity at your organization authorized to sign/certify the NOI for your site),
            and submitted to the EPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please log in to the NPDES Electronic Reporting Tool (NeT) to review and take action on this form.  NeT can
            be accessed from: <a href="${applicationLink}">${applicationLink}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, you can use the filtering capability to find the applicable NOI. Complete the sections of
            the NOI, and then choose the Route to Certifier option at the end of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not wish to complete this CGP NOI, you may delete the NOI through the table of forms located on
            your home page.  Please note that once you delete an NOI, you will not be able to complete it in the future.
            You will have to create a brand new NOI.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this email or about NeT CGP, please refer to the NeT Help Center
            at <a href="${netHelpCenter}">${netHelpCenter}</a> or e-mail ${npdesEmail} for assistance.
