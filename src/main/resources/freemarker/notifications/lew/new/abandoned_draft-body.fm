           Dear ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.firstName} ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.lastName},
        </p>
        <p>
            Our records indicate that you last modified a draft Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW) form 30 or more days ago. In order
            for your LEW form to be authorized, it must be completed, signed by the Certifier
            (i.e., the entity at your organization authorized to sign/certify the LEW for your site), and submitted to EPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please log in to the NPDES Electronic Reporting Tool (NeT) to review and take action on this form.  NeT can
            be accessed from: <a href="${applicationLink}">${applicationLink}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, you can use the filtering capability to find the applicable LEW. Complete the sections of the
            LEW, and then choose the Route to Certifier option at the end of the form.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not wish to complete this CGP LEW, you may delete the LEW through the table of forms located on
            your home page. Please note that once you delete an LEW, you will not be able to complete it in the future.
            You will have to create a brand new LEW.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have questions about this email or about NeT CGP, please refer to the NeT Help Center
            at <a href="${netHelpCenter}">${netHelpCenter}</a> or e-mail ${npdesEmail} for assistance.
