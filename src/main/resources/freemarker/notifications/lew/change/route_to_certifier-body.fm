            Changes to an existing Low Erosivity Waiver (LEW) for Exclusion from Stormwater Permitting under EPA's
            Construction General Permit (CGP) for ${form.formData.projectSiteInformation.siteName}, ${form.formData.projectSiteInformation.siteAddress},
            have been prepared by ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.firstName} ${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.lastName}
            (${form.formData.operatorInformation.preparer.email}) with you listed as the Certifier. This revised LEW
            will not be submitted to EPA until it is certified by you. Please log in to the NPDES Electronic Reporting
            Tool (NeT) to review and take action on this form.  NeT can be accessed from: <a href="${applicationLink}">${applicationLink}</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, you can use the filtering capability to find the LEW for certification.  After you have
            completed your review, follow the steps presented on the screen to certify the submission. If you choose not
            to certify the LEW, select "Reject", enter a Reason for Rejection, and submit.  This action will route the
            rejected form back to the Preparer in NeT, and generate an email notifying the Preparer that the form has
            been rejected, your reason for rejection, and instructions to resubmit as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will receive an email informing you once your request for exclusion has been accepted.   For guidance
