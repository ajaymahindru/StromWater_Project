    All areas to be affected directly or indirectly by the federal action and not merely the
    immediate area involved in the action. See 50 CFR 402. For the purposes of this permit
    and for application of the threatened and endangered species protection eligibility
    requirements, the following areas are included in the definition of action area:
    <ul>
      <li>The areas on the construction site where stormwater discharges originate and flow
        toward the point of discharge into the receiving waters (including areas where
        excavation, site development, or other ground disturbance activities occur) and the
        immediate vicinity. (Example: Where bald eagles nest in a tree that is on or bordering a
        construction site and could be disturbed by the construction activity or where grading
        causes stormwater to flow into a small wetland or other habitat that is on the site that
        contains listed species.)</li>
      <li>The areas where stormwater discharges flow from the construction site to the point of
        discharge into receiving waters. (Example: Where stormwater flows into a ditch, swale, or
        gully that leads to receiving waters and where listed species (such as listed amphibians)
        are found in the ditch, swale, or gully.)</li>
      <li>The areas where stormwater from construction activities discharges into receiving
        waters and the areas in the immediate vicinity of the point of discharge. (Example: Where
        stormwater from construction activities discharges into a stream segment that is known to
        harbor listed aquatic species.)</li>
      <li>The areas where stormwater controls will be constructed and operated, including any
        areas where stormwater flows to and from the stormwater controls. (Example: Where a
        stormwater retention pond would be built.)</li>
      <li>The areas upstream and/or downstream from the stormwater discharge into a stream
        segment that may be affected by these discharges. (Example: Where sediment discharged to
        a receiving stream settles downstream and impacts a breeding area of a listed aquatic
        species.)</li>
    </ul>
